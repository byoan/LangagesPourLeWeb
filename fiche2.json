This is an experimental, not recommended standard.</p><h2>Overview and Rational</h2><p>The following quality of service levels are available: Concorde, First, Business, and Coach. Concorde class offers expedited\ndata delivery. One major benefit to using Avian Carriers is that this is the only networking technology\nthat earns frequent flyer miles, plus the Concorde and First classes of service earn 50% bonus miles\nper packet. Ostriches are an alternate carrier that have much greater bulk transfer capability but provide\nslower delivery, and require the use of bridges between domains. The service level is indicated on a\nper-carrier basis by bar-code markings on the wing. One implementation strategy is for a bar-code reader\nto scan each carrier as it enters the router and then enqueue it in the proper queue, gated to prevent\nexit until the proper time. The carriers may sleep while enqueued. For secure networks, carriers may\nhave classes Prime or Choice. Prime carriers are self-keying when using public key encryption. Some distributors\nhave been known to falsely classify Choice carriers as Prime. Packets MAY be marked for deletion using\nRED paint while enqueued.\nWeighted fair queueing (WFQ) MAY be implemented using scales, as shown:</p><pre>\n                                                         __\n                                         _____/-----\\   / o\\\n                                        &lt;____   _____\\_/    &gt;--\n                        +-----+              \\ /    /______/\n                        |10g |                /|:||/\n                        +-----+              /____/|\n                        |10g |                     |\n                        +-----+          ..

When carrying web traffic, the carriers may\ndigest the spiders, leaving behind a more compact representation.\nThe carriers may be confused by mirrors.\n\nRound-robin queueing is not recommended.  Robins make for well-tuned\nnetworks but do not support the necessary auto-homing feature.\n\nA BOF was held at the last IETF but only Avian Carriers were allowed\nentry, so we don't know the results other than we're sure they think\nMPLS is great.  Our attempts at attaching labels to the carriers have\nbeen met with resistance.\n\nNATs are not recommended either -- as with many protocols, modifying\nthe brain-embedded IP addresses is difficult, plus Avian Carriers MAY\neat the NATs.\n\nEncapsulation may be done with saran wrappers.  Unintentional\nencapsulation in hawks has been known to occur, with decapsulation\nbeing messy and the packets mangled.\n\nLoose source routes are a viable evolutionary alternative enhanced\nstandards-based MSWindows-compliant technology, but strict source\nroutes MUST NOT be used, as they are a choke-point.\n\nThe ITU has offered the IETF formal alignment with its corresponding\ntechnology, Penguins, but that won't fly.\n\nMulticasting is supported, but requires the implementation of a clone\ndevice.  Carriers may be lost if they are based on a tree as it is\nbeing pruned.  The carriers propagate via an inheritance tree.  The\ncarriers have an average TTL of15 years, so their use in expanding\nring searches is limited.\n\nAdditional quality of service discussion can be found in a Michelin's\nguide.</p><h2>MIB and Management issues</h2><p>AvCarrier2 OBJECT-TYPE\nSYNTAX     SEQUENCE OF DNA\nMAX-ACCESS can't-read\nSTATUS     living\nDESCRIPTION 'Definition of an avian carrier'\n: :={ life eukaryotes mitochondrial_eukaryotes crown_eukaryotes\nmetazoa chordata craniata vertebrata gnathostomata\nsarcopterygii terrestrial_vertebrates amniota diapsida\narchosauromorpha archosauria dinosauria aves neornithes\ncolumbiformes columbidae columba livia    }\n\nAvCarrier OBJECT-TYPE\nSYNTAX     SET OF Cells\nMAX-ACCESS not-accessible\nSTATUS     obsolete\nDESCRIPTION 'Definition of an avian carrier'\n: :={ life animalia chordata vertebrata aves\ncolumbiformes columbidae columba livia    }\n\nPulseRate OBJECT-TYPE\nSYNTAX     Gauge(0..300)\nMAX-ACCESS read-only\n\nSTATUS     current\nDESCRIPTION 'Pulse rate of carrier, as measured in neck.\nFrequent sampling is disruptive to operations.'\n: :={ AvCarrier1    }\n\nThe carriers will not line up in lexigraphic order but will\nnaturally order in a large V shape.
