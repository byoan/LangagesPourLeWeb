This specification is primarily\nuseful in Metropolitan Area Networks.  This is an experimental, not\nrecommended standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.</p><h2>Overview and Rational</h2><p>Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low\naltitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single\npoint-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers,\nbut many carriers can be used without significant interference with\neach other, outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether\nspace available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by\nIEEE802.3.  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance\nsystem, which increases availability.  Unlike some network\ntechnologies, such as packet radio, communication is not limited to\nline-of-sight distance.  Connection oriented service is available in\nsome cities, usually based upon a central hub topology.</p><h2>Frame Format</h2><p>The IP datagram is printed, on a small scroll of paper, in\nhexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff.\nThe scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier.\nA band of duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges.  The\nbandwidth is limited to the leg length.  The MTU is variable, and\nparadoxically, generally increases with increased carrier age.  A\ntypical MTU is 256 milligrams.  Some datagram padding may be needed.\n\nUpon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of the\ndatagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable\nform.</p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized pecking\norder.  An additional property is built-in worm detection and\neradication.  Because IP only guarantees best effort delivery, loss\nof a carrier can be tolerated.  With time, the carriers are self-regenerating.\nWhile broadcasting is not specified, storms can cause\ndata loss.  There is persistent delivery retry, until the carrier\ndrops.  Audit trails are automatically generated, and can often be\nfound on logs and cable trays.</p><h2>Security Considerations</h2><p>Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special\nmeasures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers\nare used in a tactical environment.</p></section><h2>Authors' Addresses</h2><address><p>David Waitzman\nBBN Systems and Technologies Corporation\nBBN Labs Division\n10 Moulton Street\nCambridge, MA 02238\n\nPhone: (617) 873-4323\n\nEMail: dwaitzman@BBN.COM</p></address></section><aside class='large-2 medium-12 small-12 cell' id='tags'><div id='relatedArticles'><h3>Related articles</h3><a id='1' href='#' class='button primary'><i class='fi-link'></i> A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers</a><a id='2' href='#' class='hollow button'><i class='fi-link'></i> IP over Avian Carriers with Quality of Service</a> <a id='3' href='#' class='hollow button'><i class='fi-link'></i> Adaptation of RFC 1149 for IPv6</a></div><div id='tagsContainer'><h3>Tags</h3><button class='hollow button'><i class='fi-price-tag'></i> RFC</button> <button class='hollow button'><i class='fi-price-tag'></i> Avian Carriers</button> <button class='hollow button'><i class='fi-price-tag'></i> IP Datagrams</button> <button class='hollow button'><i class='fi-price-tag'></i> Standard</button></div></aside>"
